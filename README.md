# Loan Repayment Prediction

This project aims to predict whether customers of a Microfinance Institution (MFI) will repay their loans within 5 days. The prediction model uses data provided by a Telecom Industry, focusing on customer behavior and other relevant features.

## Project Overview

Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) provide small loans to individuals who do not have access to traditional banking services. Predicting loan repayment behavior is crucial for MFIs to manage risk and ensure financial sustainability. By leveraging data science and machine learning techniques, this project aims to build a robust model to predict loan repayment probabilities.
