# Loan Repayment Prediction

This project aims to predict whether customers of a Microfinance Institution (MFI) will repay their loans within 5 days. The prediction model uses data provided by a Telecom Industry, focusing on customer behavior and other relevant features.

## Project Overview

Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) provide small loans to individuals who do not have access to traditional banking services. Predicting loan repayment behavior is crucial for MFIs to manage risk and ensure financial sustainability. By leveraging data science and machine learning techniques, this project aims to build a robust model to predict loan repayment probabilities.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/loan-repayment-prediction.git
cd loan-repayment-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is obtained from the Telecom Industry, containing features such as customer behavior, demographic information, and loan details. The dataset is not included in this repository due to privacy concerns.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering plays a critical role in this project. Key steps include:

- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Scaling numerical features
- Creating new features from existing ones

## Model Training

Several machine learning models were evaluated to find the best-performing model. The process includes:

- Splitting the data into training and testing sets
- Training various models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search and Random Search

## Evaluation

The models were evaluated using metrics such as:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Log Loss

## Results

The final model achieved the following performance metrics:

- Accuracy: 85%
- Precision: 80%
- Recall: 78%
- F1 Score: 79%
- Log Loss: 0.45

## Usage

To use the model for predictions, run the following script:

```bash
python predict.py --input data/new_customers.csv --output predictions.csv
```
